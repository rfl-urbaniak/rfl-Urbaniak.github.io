  Rafal is a philosophy professor obsessed with data and in love with  <b> R</b>. He enjoys probabilistic (especially bayesian) thinking about issues that he is convinced matter a lot. These include  criminal evidence evaluation, the study of online aggression and its mitigation measures, measures of bias in natural language processing tools, the use of Monte Carlo methods to argue that standard backtesting methods in algorithmic trading are flawed, or imprecise probabilities in expert testimony.
