title: "The value of cold-hits in DNA identification (2)"

The NRC formed the Committee on DNA Technology in Forensic Science, which issued its first report in 1992.  In that report they advised against using cold hit results as evidence, and insisted that only the frequencies related to loci not used in the original identification should be presented at trial, that is, that the evidence used to identify the suspect should not be used as evidence against the suspect.



This recommendation has been criticized by many because it underestimates the value of cold-hit matches. The problem was, given a certain amount of evidence the expert, prior to suspect identification, had to make a somewhat subjective decision of how to  divide the evidence into two items: one to be used only in the suspect identification, and one to be used only in the trial itself as evidence against the suspect. This overly limited the utility of the evidence and introduced an unnecessary element of subjectivity. It also opened the gate for multiple testing with various evidence division points, and multiple testing leads to its own statistical problems. But let's put this issue aside.


NRC II withdrew the earlier recommendation. However, the contrast between low RMP and the frequency of DNA matches in actual database searchers was indeed stark.  For instance, the Arizona Department of Public Safety searched for matching profiles in a database comprising 65,000 individuals. The search found 122 pairs of people whose DNA  partially matched at 9 out of 13 loci; 20 pairs people who matched at 10 loci; and one pair of people who matches at 12 loci. So it is not that unlikely to find two people in a database who share the same genetic profiles  (examples of fairly high counts of DNA matches in database searches  was actually used by Barlow in the Diana Sylvester case). In light of this contrast, NRC II recommended the use of DMP rather than RMP.  NRC II recommended also that in cold-hit cases the likelihood ratio $R$ associated with the DNA match should be divided by $d+1$. Their first  recommendation was about a correction of the random match probability, and this second recommendation is about the likelihood ratio.


One argument by NRC employed an analogy involving  coin tosses.  If you toss several different coins at once and all show heads on the first attempt, this seems strong evidence that the coins are biased. If, however, you repeat this experiment sufficiently many times, it is almost certain that at some point all coins will land heads.
This outcome should not count as evidence that the coins are biased. According to NRC II, repeating the coin toss experiment multiple times is analogous to trying to find a match by searching through a database of profiles.  As the size of the database increases,  so does  the number of attempts at finding a match, and
 it is more likely that someone in the database who had nothing to do with the crime would  match.


Another argument provided by NRC II compared a database trawl to multiple hypothesis testing, and multiple hypothesis testing should be avoided if possible in light of  classical statistical methods.


Third, NRC II was concerned with the fact that in cold-hit cases the identification of a particular defendant occurs after testing several individuals. This concern has to do with the data-dependency of one's hypothesis: seemingly, the hypothesis `at least one person in a given database matches the DNA profile in question' changes its content with the choice of the database.
