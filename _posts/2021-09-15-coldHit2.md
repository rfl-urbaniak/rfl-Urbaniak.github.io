The NRC formed the Committee on DNA Technology in Forensic Science, which issued its first report in 1992.  In that report they advised against using cold hit results as evidence, and insisted that only the frequencies related to loci not used in the original identification should be presented at trial, that is, that the evidence used to identify the suspect should not be used as evidence against the suspect.
