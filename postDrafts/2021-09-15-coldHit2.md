title: "The value of cold-hits in DNA identification (2)"

The NRC formed the Committee on DNA Technology in Forensic Science, which issued its first report in 1992.  In that report they advised against using cold hit results as evidence, and insisted that only the frequencies related to loci not used in the original identification should be presented at trial, that is, that the evidence used to identify the suspect should not be used as evidence against the suspect.



This recommendation has been criticized by many because it underestimates the value of cold-hit matches. The problem was, given a certain amount of evidence the expert, prior to suspect identification, had to make a somewhat subjective decision of how to  divide the evidence into two items: one to be used only in the suspect identification, and one to be used only in the trial itself as evidence against the suspect. This overly limited the utility of the evidence and introduced an unnecessary element of subjectivity. It also opened the gate for multiple testing with various evidence division points, and multiple testing leads to its own statistical problems. But let's put this issue aside.
