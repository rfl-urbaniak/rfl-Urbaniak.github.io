False positives
================

Last time we derived one formula for the impact of false positive probability on the value of DNA evidence. Today, we'll look at seemingly different formula to get a better perspective. Buckleton, Bright, & Taylor (2018) give a formula for the impact of errors on likelihood ratio different from the one we discussed before. Since the derivation is simpler and it turns out that in fact this is simply a more general formula, of which the one we already discussed is just a particular instance, it worth taking a look.

First, Buckleton et al. (2018) make the conceptual distinction between the probability that an error occurs (![E](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E "E")) and the probability that a match is reported if it does. In terms of our notation, we have:
